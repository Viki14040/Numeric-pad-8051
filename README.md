# Numeric Keypad Simulation with 8051 Microcontroller

This project demonstrates the simulation of a numeric keypad connected to an 8051 microcontroller using Keil uVision and Proteus software. The setup includes the interfacing of a keypad with the 8051 microcontroller, simulated using Keil uVision for code development and Proteus for hardware simulation.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to simulate a numeric keypad interface with the 8051 microcontroller. It involves coding in Keil uVision and simulating the hardware setup in Proteus.

## Components Used

- **Microcontroller:** 8051
- **Software:**
  - **Keil uVision:** For code development and compilation.
  - **Proteus:** For hardware simulation and testing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Keil uVision:** Download and install from [Keil's website](https://www.keil.com/download/).
- **Proteus:** Download and install from [Labcenter's website](https://www.labcenter.com/).

### Setup Instructions

1. **Keil uVision Setup:**
   - Open Keil uVision.
   - Create a new project and select the 8051 microcontroller.
   - Write or import the code to handle keypad input.

2. **Proteus Setup:**
   - Open Proteus and create a new project.
   - Add the 8051 microcontroller and numeric keypad components to the schematic.
   - Connect the keypad to the microcontroller as per the design.
   - Load the hex file generated by Keil uVision into the 8051 microcontroller in Proteus.

### Running the Simulation

1. **Compile Code:**
   - In Keil uVision, compile the code to generate the hex file.

2. **Load and Simulate:**
   - In Proteus, load the hex file into the microcontroller.
   - Start the simulation to test the keypad interface.

3. **Verify Functionality:**
   - Press keys on the virtual keypad within Proteus.
   - Observe the microcontroller's response to ensure proper functionality.

## Code

The source code for handling the keypad input is located in the `src` directory of this repository. Key files include:

- `keypad.c` - Contains the implementation for keypad scanning.
